### OOP Concepts
**Abstraction:** Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user. Abstraction lets you focus on what the object does instead of how it does it. You can achieve abstraction in Java through abstract classes and interfaces.
**Abstract Class:** 
 - Contain mixed methods declared with or without implementation
 - Declare fields that are not static and final
 - Define access modifiers public, protected, and private for concrete methods.
**Interfaces:**
 - All fields are automatically public, static, final
 - All methods are public
**Abstract Classes vs Interfaces:** Extending an abstract class is saying your class IS something. Implementing an interface is saying your class DOES something. Tacoma extends Toyota implements Drivable.
